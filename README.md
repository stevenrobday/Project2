# Project 2

In this updated version of TeleAdvise, we added login and comment features to our site. Users will be able to login and comment on the shows or movies they search for. Also, we have updated the files to follow an MVC folder structure. In addition, this file is now full stack utilizing a Node and Express Web Server backed to a MySQL database to hold our comment and login information. 

In the future, we are going to add a Favorites/Recommendations feature where users will be able to save their favorite shows/movies for easy access in the future and also have shows/movies recommended to them based off past search history.
